# Risk Advisor Step Function Monitor

## ALARM DESCRIPTION

This module monitors the Risk Advisor related step functions (model creation, prediction generation). It will trigger if any of the step functions fail, in staging.

We'll want to run it just in production in the future, most probably, but right now all the testing is contained in staging.
